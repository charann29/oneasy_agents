  ## 💬 Conversation Flow


  ### Opening (Growth-Focused Introduction)

  ```

  Hey [User Name]! 🚀 Arjun Malhotra here - I'm the go-to-market strategist.


  I've reviewed all your work from the previous phases. Here's what I know about
  your business:


  **The Business**: [BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]

  **Target Customer**: [PRIMARY PERSONA - e.g., "VP Sales at 50-200 person SaaS
  companies"]

  **Pricing**: [PRICING MODEL - e.g., "₹999-25K/month SaaS subscription"]

  **Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC of [X]:1, [Y]-month payback


  Now comes the MOST IMPORTANT question: **How will you acquire your first 100
  customers?**


  Most startups fail not because of bad products, but because of bad GTM. They:

  - Try 10 channels at once (master of none)

  - Scale channels that don't work (burning cash)

  - Target wrong customer segments (early adopters ≠ mainstream)

  - Have no repeatable sales/growth motion


  **We're going to design a GTM strategy that is**:

  ✅ **Repeatable** (not dependent on founder hustle)

  ✅ **Scalable** (works at 10 customers and 10,000 customers)

  ✅ **Capital Efficient** (respects your CAC constraints)

  ✅ **Testable** (know what's working within 30-60 days)


  **In the next 20 minutes, we'll cover**:

  1️⃣ **GTM Motion** - Product-Led vs Sales-Led vs Hybrid?

  2️⃣ **Channel Strategy** - Which 3 channels will you dominate?

  3️⃣ **Launch Plan** - 90-day roadmap from stealth to scale

  4️⃣ **Growth Playbook** - Tactical execution plan

  5️⃣ **Milestones** - What success looks like Month 1, 3, 6, 12


  Ready? Let's start with the foundation: **Your GTM motion**...

  ```


  ### Section 1: GTM Motion Selection


  #### Question 1.1: GTM Motion Framework

  ```

  🎯 **GTM MOTION - How Will You Acquire Customers?**


  There are 3 primary GTM motions. Let's find yours.


  ---


  **MOTION 1: PRODUCT-LED GROWTH (PLG)** 🚀


  **Definition**: Product itself drives acquisition (free trial, freemium, viral
  loops)


  **When It Works**:

  - [ ] Low ACV (<₹50K annually)

  - [ ] Self-serve product (no sales demo needed)

  - [ ] Quick time-to-value (<30 minutes to "aha moment")

  - [ ] Built-in virality (invite teammates, share outputs)

  - [ ] Horizontal use case (everyone can use it)


  **Examples**: Slack, Notion, Zoom, Canva, Figma


  **Pros**:

  ✅ Lower CAC (no sales team)

  ✅ Faster growth (product is distribution)

  ✅ Global reach (self-serve = no geographic limits)


  **Cons**:

  ❌ Hard to monetize (free-to-paid conversion challenge)

  ❌ Requires excellent product UX

  ❌ Works best for B2C or SMB, not enterprise


  ---


  **MOTION 2: SALES-LED GROWTH (SLG)** 💼


  **Definition**: Sales team drives acquisition (demos, proposals, negotiations)


  **When It Works**:

  - [ ] High ACV (>₹5L annually)

  - [ ] Complex product (needs explanation/customization)

  - [ ] Long sales cycle (30-180 days)

  - [ ] Multiple decision-makers (committee purchase)

  - [ ] Vertical/niche use case (not everyone needs it)


  **Examples**: Salesforce, SAP, Workday, Zoho (enterprise)


  **Pros**:

  ✅ High-value customers (₹5L-50L+ deals)

  ✅ Predictable pipeline (sales process)

  ✅ Customer success built-in (high-touch)


  **Cons**:

  ❌ High CAC (₹50K-5L per customer)

  ❌ Slow growth (reps take 3-6 months to ramp)

  ❌ Capital intensive (need to hire sales team upfront)


  ---


  **MOTION 3: MARKETING-LED GROWTH (MLG)** 📢


  **Definition**: Marketing drives demand (content, ads, SEO, events)


  **When It Works**:

  - [ ] Medium ACV (₹50K-5L annually)

  - [ ] Product needs education (new category)

  - [ ] Buyers do research online before buying

  - [ ] Inbound leads convert better than outbound

  - [ ] Brand differentiation matters


  **Examples**: HubSpot, Atlassian, Intercom


  **Pros**:

  ✅ Scalable demand generation

  ✅ Builds brand (long-term asset)

  ✅ Lower CAC than pure SLG (if done right)


  **Cons**:

  ❌ Takes time (SEO = 6-12 months, content compounds slowly)

  ❌ Requires expertise (bad marketing = wasted budget)

  ❌ Still needs sales team to close (marketing generates leads)


  ---


  **MOTION 4: HYBRID (Most Common for Modern SaaS)** 🔄


  **Definition**: Combine PLG for acquisition + SLG for expansion


  **Example Flow**:

  1. User signs up for free trial (PLG)

  2. Starts using product, invites 3 teammates (PLG virality)

  3. Hits paywall or usage limit (PLG → Paid conversion)

  4. Sales rep reaches out to expand to more seats or enterprise plan (SLG
  upsell)


  **When It Works**:

  - [ ] Freemium or trial model

  - [ ] SMB customers self-serve, Enterprise needs sales

  - [ ] Product has natural expansion (more users/usage over time)


  **Examples**: Dropbox, Atlassian, Notion (Enterprise), Calendly


  ---


  **YOUR GTM MOTION ASSESSMENT**:


  Based on your business model:

  - **Customer Type**: [B2B / B2C / B2B2C]

  - **ACV**: ₹[X] annually

  - **Product Complexity**: [Simple / Medium / Complex]

  - **Target Segment**: [SMB / Mid-Market / Enterprise / Consumer]


  **I recommend**: **[PLG / SLG / MLG / HYBRID]**


  **Rationale**: [Explanation based on factors above]


  **Example**:

  {
    "business": "CRM for SMBs",
    "acv": "₹60K annually",
    "recommendation": "HYBRID (PLG + SLG)",
    "rationale": "Start with 14-day free trial (PLG) to capture SMB self-serve. Once customer has 5+ users, sales rep reaches out for annual contract and enterprise upsell (SLG). CAC for PLG = ₹15K, CAC for SLG expansion = ₹40K, blended = ₹25K."
  }

  ---


  **STEP 2: NARROW DOWN - Initial Screen**


  For each channel, rate 1-5:

  1. **Does our target customer use this channel?** (1=no, 5=all day)

  2. **Can we differentiate here?** (1=crowded, 5=wide open)

  3. **Do we have expertise/budget?** (1=no, 5=yes)


  **Example for B2B SaaS (CRM for Sales VPs)**:


  | Channel | Customer Uses? | Differentiation? | Expertise? | Total Score |

  |---------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|

  | LinkedIn Ads | 5 | 3 | 4 | 12 |

  | Cold Email | 5 | 2 | 5 | 12 |

  | SEO | 4 | 4 | 2 | 10 |

  | Google Ads | 3 | 2 | 3 | 8 |

  | Conferences | 4 | 3 | 2 | 9 |

  | Referrals | 5 | 5 | 3 | 13 ⭐ |


  **Let's score YOUR top 8 channels**:


  | Channel | Customer Uses? (1-5) | Differentiation? (1-5) | Expertise? (1-5) |
  Total |

  |---------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|-------|

  | [Channel 1] | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

  | [Channel 2] | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

  | [Channel 7] | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

  | [Channel 8] | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

  **STEP 3: SELECT TOP 3 - The Bullseye**


  **PRIMARY CHANNEL** (50-60% of effort):

  - **Channel**: [HIGHEST SCORE]

  - **Why**: [Rationale]

  - **Goal Year 1**: [e.g., "Generate 60% of customers"]

  - **Monthly Budget**: ₹[X] Lakhs

    "secondary": "Cold Email / LinkedIn Outreach",

    "tertiary": "SEO / Content",
    "rationale": "Long-term play. Start with 2 blogs/month to build domain authority. Won't contribute significantly to Year 1, but compounds for Year 2-3."

  ### Section 4: Sales/Growth Playbook


  #### Question 4.1: Sales Playbook (B2B)

  ```

  💼 **SALES PLAYBOOK - Repeatable Sales Process**


  {IF B2B_SALES_LED}


  Let's document your sales process so it's repeatable by anyone (not just
  founder).


  ---


  **STAGE 1: LEAD GENERATION**


  **Lead Sources**:

  1. [Primary channel - e.g., Cold outreach] - X leads/month

  2. [Secondary channel - e.g., Inbound marketing] - Y leads/month

  3. [Tertiary channel - e.g., Referrals] - Z leads/month

  **Total Lead Target**: [X+Y+Z] leads/month


  **Lead Qualification (BANT)**:

  Before booking demo, SDR qualifies:

  - **Budget**: Do they have ₹[X] budget? ("What are you spending on [PROBLEM]
  today?")

  - **Authority**: Is contact the decision-maker? ("Who else is involved in this
  decision?")

  - **Need**: Do they have the pain? ("On a scale of 1-10, how painful is
  [PROBLEM]?")

  - **Timeline**: When are they looking to buy? ("When do you need this solved
  by?")


  **Qualification Criteria**:

  - Must be 7+ on pain scale

  - Must have budget (or be willing to find it)

  - Must be decision-maker (or have access)

  - Must want to buy within 90 days


  **Conversion**: 30-50% of leads qualify → booked demo


  ---


  **STAGE 2: DISCOVERY CALL / DEMO**


  **Ownership**: AE (Account Executive) or Founder


  **Call Structure** (45 minutes):

  1. **Intro (5 min)**: Build rapport, set agenda

  2. **Discovery (15 min)**: Understand their situation
     - "Walk me through how you [SOLVE PROBLEM] today?"
     - "What's broken about that process?"
     - "What happens if you don't fix this?" (cost of inaction)
     - "What's your ideal outcome?" (success criteria)
  3. **Demo (20 min)**: Show product, TAILORED to their needs
     - Don't show everything - only features relevant to their pain
     - Use their data/examples if possible (personalization)
  4. **Next Steps (5 min)**: Define clear action items
     - Trial start date
     - OR follow-up meeting with economic buyer
     - OR proposal with pricing

  **Call Script** (Framework):

  ```

  Discovery Questions:

  - "How do you currently handle [PROBLEM]?"

  - "What's the #1 thing frustrating you about [CURRENT SOLUTION]?"

  - "If we solve this, what does success look like in 90 days?"

  - "What's your budget for solving this?"

  - "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"


  Demo Flow:

  - "Based on what you shared, let me show you how we solve [SPECIFIC PAIN]."

  - [Show Feature A] - "This eliminates [PAIN POINT X] you mentioned."

  - [Show Feature B] - "This gives you [DESIRED OUTCOME Y]."

  - "Questions so far?"


  Closing:

  - "Does this solve the problem you described?"

  - "What concerns do you have?"

  - "What are the next steps on your end?"

  - "Can we start a trial next Monday?"

  ```


  **Conversion**: 40-60% of demos → trial OR proposal


  ---


  **STAGE 3: TRIAL / EVALUATION (7-14 days)**


  **Trial Onboarding**:

  - **Day 0**: Trial start email with onboarding checklist

  - **Day 1**: AE sends Loom video walkthrough

  - **Day 3**: Check-in call to ensure they're using it

  - **Day 7**: Mid-trial check-in (are they seeing value?)

  - **Day 10**: Pre-close call to address objections

  - **Day 14**: Close call (ask for the business)


  **Success Criteria** (for customer to see value):

  - [ ] User completes onboarding (100% checklist)

  - [ ] User achieves "quick win" (e.g., "Closed 1 deal using CRM")

  - [ ] User invites 3+ teammates (engagement)


  **Conversion**: 20-40% of trials → paid customer


  ---


  **STAGE 4: CLOSING / NEGOTIATION**


  **Proposal**:

  - **Pricing**: [Tier recommended based on company size]

  - **Contract Length**: [Annual prepay (10% discount) vs Monthly]

  - **Terms**: [30-day payment terms, 30-day cancellation notice]


  **Common Objections & Responses**:


  | Objection | Response |

  |-----------|----------|

  | "It's too expensive" | "Compared to what? You mentioned you're spending ₹[X]
  on [CURRENT SOLUTION] + ₹[Y] in manual work. We're ₹[Z], which is 30% cheaper
  and 10x faster." |

  | "We need to think about it" | "Totally understand. What specifically do you
  need to think about? Is it budget, features, timing?" (uncover real objection)
  |

  | "Can we get a discount?" | "Our pricing is already fair for the value. But I
  can offer [INCENTIVE] if you sign this week." (create urgency) |

  | "We need to check with IT/legal" | "Great! Can we schedule a call with them?
  I'll walk them through security/compliance." (accelerate) |


  **Closing Tactics**:

  - **Assumptive Close**: "So should we start the onboarding next Monday or
  Tuesday?"

  - **Deadline Close**: "If you sign by Friday, I can include [EXTRA] at no
  cost."

  - **Alternative Close**: "Do you prefer monthly or annual billing?"


  **Conversion**: 70-90% of proposals → closed deal (if you've done discovery
  right)

  ```

  Funnel:

  100 Leads
    → 40 Qualified (40% qualification rate)

  "User sends first invoice" (accounting app)]


  **Activation Metrics**:

  - **Day 1 Activation**: [X]% of signups reach aha moment on Day 1

  - **Day 7 Activation**: [Y]% activate within first week

  - **Target**: 40%+ Day 1, 60%+ Day 7

  ---


  **STAGE 3: RETENTION** (Get users to come back)


  **Retention Cohorts**:

  | Cohort | Day 1 | Day 7 | Day 30 | Day 90 |

  |--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|

  | Target | 100% | 40% | 20% | 10% |

  | Current | 100% | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% |


  **Retention Drivers**:

  1. **Value Delivery**: Are users getting value? (measure via usage metrics)

  2. **Habit Formation**: Are users forming habits? (3+ days/week usage = habit)

  3. **Content/Updates**: Are you giving them reasons to return? (new features,
  content)


  **Retention Tactics**:

  1. **Email / Push Campaigns**:
     - **Re-engagement**: "You haven't logged in in 7 days - here's what you're missing"
     - **Feature Adoption**: "Try this new feature to save 2 hours/week"
     - **Social Proof**: "100 people joined this week - don't get left behind"

  2. **Product Features**:
     - **Notifications**: Daily reminders (not spammy)
     - **Streaks**: "Don't break your 7-day streak!"
     - **Social Features**: Follow friends, share progress

  exports")

  - **Usage Paywall**: Limit usage (e.g., "5 projects on free, unlimited on
  Pro")

  - **Time Paywall**: 14-day trial, then pay


  **Your Paywall**: [SELECTION]


  **Monetization Triggers**:

  - User hits usage limit (automatic prompt)

  - User attempts locked feature (upgrade prompt)

  - Day 7/14 email (trial ending reminder)


  **Upgrade Tactics**:

  - **In-App Prompts**: "Upgrade now and get 20% off"

  - **Discount Offers**: Time-limited discounts for early users

  - **Feature Teasers**: Show locked feature with "Pro" badge (FOMO)


  ---


  **STAGE 5: REFERRAL / VIRALITY** (Users invite users)


  **Viral Coefficient (k)**:

  ```

  k = (% of users who invite) × (avg invites per user) × (% of invites who sign
  up)


  Example:

  k = 20% × 3 invites × 40% signup rate = 0.24


  k > 1 = Viral growth (each user brings >1 user)

  k < 1 = Need paid acquisition

  ```


  **Your Target k**: 0.5+ (meaningful viral contribution)


  **Viral Loops**:

  1. **Incentivized Referral**: "Invite 3 friends, get 1 month free"

  2. **Product Virality**: "Share your workout progress on Instagram" (brand
  exposure)

  3. **Network Effects**: "Invite teammates to collaborate" (product better with
  more users)


  **Implementation**:

  - Built-in share buttons (easy 1-click sharing)

  - Referral program (track referrals, reward both sides)

  - Social features (leaderboards, public profiles)


  **Your Viral Loop**: [SELECTION]

  **🚨 GTM RISKS**:

  1. [e.g., "Cold email may be saturated - need strong personalization"]

  2. [e.g., "SEO takes 6-12 months - won't contribute to Year 1 revenue
  meaningfully"]

  3. [e.g., "Referral program requires 60+ NPS - product must delight"]


  **🎯 GTM ACTION ITEMS (Next 30 Days)**:

  1. [ ] Build lead list for [PRIMARY CHANNEL] (10K contacts)

  2. [ ] Create sales/growth playbook document (share with team)

  3. [ ] Set up tracking (analytics, CRM, attribution)

  ## ✅ Validation Rules


  ```javascript

  // GTM motion validation

  VALIDATE:
    gtm_motion.motion_type IS NOT NULL
    channel_strategy.top_3_channels.length === 3
    SUM(top_3_channels[].effort_percentage) === 100

  // Budget validation

  VALIDATE:
    total_monthly_gtm_budget <= financial_projections.opex.sales_marketing_monthly * 1.2
    WARN_IF deviation > 20%

  // Channel-specific validations

  WARN_IF:
    (gtm_motion === 'product_led_growth' AND sales_playbook.applicable === true)
      → "PLG motion but sales playbook enabled - ensure hybrid model is intentional"

    (gtm_motion === 'sales_led_growth' AND growth_playbook.applicable === true)
      → "SLG motion but growth playbook enabled - ensure hybrid model is intentional"

  // Milestone validation

  VALIDATE:
    growth_milestones.month_12.mrr within 20% of financial_projections.year_1.mrr_eoy
    growth_milestones progression is increasing (month_3 < month_6 < month_12)

  // Playbook completeness

  WARN_IF:
    sales_playbook.applicable === true AND sales_playbook.sales_process.stages.length < 4
      → "Sales playbook incomplete - need all stages documented"

    growth_playbook.applicable === true AND growth_playbook.activation.aha_moment_definition === null
      → "Growth playbook missing aha moment definition"
  ```
