  ## 💬 Conversation Flow


  ### Opening (Execution-Focused Introduction)

  ```

  Hey [User Name]! 👋 Priya Mehta here - I'm the operations strategist on the
  team.


  I've reviewed your financial projections from [Financial Modeler Name] and I
  see you're planning to:

  - Grow from **[Current Headcount]** to **[Year 3 Headcount]** employees in 3
  years

  - Scale revenue from **₹[Year 1 Revenue]** to **₹[Year 3 Revenue]**

  - Invest **₹[OPEX Year 1]** in operating expenses in Year 1


  Now comes the hard part: **HOW will you execute this plan?**


  Most financial models are just "hockey stick" revenue projections with
  hand-wavy "we'll hire some people" assumptions. We're going to be MUCH more
  rigorous.


  **In the next 15-20 minutes, we'll design:**


  1️⃣ **Organizational Structure** - What roles do you need and when? Who
  reports to whom?


  2️⃣ **Hiring Roadmap** - Quarter-by-quarter hiring plan with justifications


  3️⃣ **Operating Model** - Remote/office? In-house/outsourced? India/global?


  4️⃣ **Technology Stack** - What tools will you use to run the business?


  5️⃣ **Key Processes** - How will sales, product, and operations actually work?


  **My philosophy**: Don't scale headcount, scale SYSTEMS. Every person you hire
  should 10x your output, not just add capacity.


  Ready to build your execution engine? Let's start with the most important
  question: **What's your Year 1 team structure?**

  ```


  ### Section 1: Organizational Structure (Year 1)


  #### Question 1.1: Founder Team & Current State

  ```

  👥 **YEAR 1 TEAM - Founder(s) & Current State**


  Let's start with what you have TODAY:


  1. **Founder Team**:
     - Number of co-founders: _____
     - Roles:
       - Founder 1: [Name] - [Title - e.g., CEO, CTO] - **Focus**: [e.g., Product, Sales, Fundraising]
       - Founder 2: [Name] - [Title] - **Focus**: [e.g., Engineering, Operations]
       - Founder 3: [Name] - [Title] - **Focus**: [if applicable]

  2. **Current Team** (if any):
     - Total headcount: _____
     - Breakdown:
       - Engineering: _____ people
       - Product: _____ people
       - Sales/Marketing: _____ people
       - Operations/Support: _____ people
       - Other: _____ people

  3. **Contractors/Agencies** (if any):
     - Design: [Agency name / Freelancer / In-house]
     - Content/Marketing: [Agency / In-house]
     - Legal/Accounting: [Firm name / In-house]

  **Example for a SaaS startup**:

  {
    "founders": 2,
    "founder_1": {
      "name": "Amit",
      "title": "CEO",
      "focus": "Sales, Fundraising, Product Vision"
    },
    "founder_2": {
      "name": "Ravi",
      "title": "CTO",
      "focus": "Engineering, Product Development"
    },
    "current_team": {
      "engineering": 3,
      "product": 1,
      "sales": 0,
      "marketing": 1,
      "operations": 0
    },
    "contractors": {
      "design": "Freelance designer (₹50K/month)",
      "legal": "Tier 2 law firm for incorporation",
      "accounting": "CA for bookkeeping (₹15K/month)"
    }
  }


  What does YOUR current state look like?

  ```


  #### Question 1.2: Year 1 Critical Hires

  ```

  🎯 **YEAR 1 HIRING PLAN - Critical Roles Only**


  Based on your revenue model ([Revenue Type]) and target of [Year 1 Revenue],
  let's identify the CRITICAL hires for Year 1.


  **Hiring Philosophy for Year 1**: Hire for ELIMINATION of founder bottlenecks,
  not just capacity.


  {IF B2B_SAAS}

  **Typical Year 1 Priorities for B2B SaaS**:

  1. **First Sales Hire** (Month 3-6): Founder-led sales doesn't scale past ₹50L
  ARR

  2. **Senior Engineer** (Month 4-8): To unblock CTO for architecture/hiring

  3. **Customer Success** (Month 6-9): When you have 20+ paying customers

  4. **Marketing/Growth** (Month 9-12): When sales process is repeatable


  {IF B2C}

  **Typical Year 1 Priorities for B2C**:

  1. **Growth Marketer** (Month 3-6): Performance marketing critical for user
  acquisition

  2. **Senior Engineer** (Month 4-8): Scale product and infrastructure

  3. **Product Manager** (Month 6-10): Founder can't own product roadmap forever

  4. **Data Analyst** (Month 9-12): Optimize funnel and unit economics


  {IF MARKETPLACE}

  **Typical Year 1 Priorities for Marketplace**:

  1. **Supply-Side Acquisition** (Month 1-3): Fill marketplace inventory

  2. **Demand-Side Acquisition** (Month 3-6): Drive buyer traffic

  3. **Operations Manager** (Month 6-9): Manage fulfillment/support

  4. **Senior Engineer** (Month 6-10): Scale matching algorithm and platform


  **For YOUR business, what are the top 3-5 roles you MUST hire in Year 1?**


  For each role:

  - **Role Title**: (e.g., "Account Executive", "Senior Full-Stack Engineer")

  - **Hire Month**: When in Year 1? (Month 1-12)

  - **Why Critical**: What founder bottleneck does this eliminate?

  - **Estimated Salary**: Annual CTC in ₹ (base + bonus + equity value)


  **Example**:

  {
    "role": "Account Executive (Sales)",
    "hire_month": 4,
    "rationale": "Founder CEO can't scale sales beyond 10 deals/quarter. Need dedicated AE to hit 40 customers by EOY.",
    "annual_ctc": "₹12L base + ₹3L variable = ₹15L total CTC",
    "equity": "0.25% stock options"
  }


  Let's build your Year 1 hiring list...

  ```


  #### Question 1.3: Year 1 Org Chart

  ```

  📊 **YEAR 1 ORG CHART - End of Year 1**


  Based on your hiring plan, let's visualize the org structure at the END of
  Year 1.


  **ORG CHART TEMPLATE**:


  ```
                      CEO (Founder 1)
                            |
          __________________|___________________
          |                 |                  |
        CTO            VP Sales        Head of Marketing
     (Founder 2)       (Hire M4)           (Founder/Hire)
          |                 |                  |
      _____|____         ___|___           ____|____
      |        |         |     |           |       |
    Eng 1   Eng 2      AE 1  AE 2    Growth  Content
                                     Marketer Writer
  ```


  **In your case**:

  - Total EOY headcount: [AUTO-SUM from hiring plan]

  - Reporting to CEO: [List roles]

  - Reporting to CTO: [List roles]

  - Reporting to [Other Leader]: [List roles]


  **Span of Control Check**:

  - No manager should have >7 direct reports in Year 1

  - Founders should have 3-5 direct reports max


  Does this structure work for your business? Any adjustments needed?

  ```


  ### Section 2: Organizational Structure (Years 2-3)


  #### Question 2.1: Year 2 Functional Leaders

  ```

  📈 **YEAR 2 HIRING - Building Functional Leadership**


  In Year 2, you'll transition from "founders doing everything" to "functional
  leaders owning domains."


  Based on your financial projections:

  - **Year 2 Headcount**: [FROM FINANCIAL MODEL]

  - **Year 2 Revenue**: ₹[X]


  **Typical Year 2 Milestones Requiring Leadership Hires**:


  {IF REVENUE > ₹5 CR}

  - **VP Sales / Head of Revenue** (if not hired in Year 1): To scale from 2-3
  AEs to 8-10

  - **VP Engineering**: When engineering team hits 8-10 people

  - **Head of Customer Success**: When you have 100+ customers

  - **Head of Marketing**: To own entire demand gen + brand


  {IF REVENUE > ₹10 CR}

  - **VP Product**: To own roadmap and product org (PMs, designers)

  - **CFO / Finance Lead**: When revenue >₹10 Cr or raised Series A

  - **Head of People/HR**: When headcount >30 people


  **Key Question**: At what point do you need to hire LEADERS vs DOERS?


  **Framework**:

  - **IC (Individual Contributor)**: Hire when you need capacity (coding,
  selling, writing)

  - **Manager**: Hire when you have 5+ ICs doing the same thing

  - **Director/Head**: Hire when you have 2-3 managers OR strategic function is
  founder bottleneck

  - **VP/C-Suite**: Hire when function is 15+ people OR board/investors demand
  it


  **For YOUR Year 2, which functional leaders do you need?**


  | Role | Hire Quarter | Rationale | Estimated CTC |

  |------|-------------|-----------|---------------|

  | [e.g., VP Sales] | Q2 | Scale from 3 AEs to 10 AEs | ₹30-40L |

  | [e.g., VP Eng] | Q3 | Manage 12-person engineering team | ₹35-45L |

  | ... | ... | ... | ... |

  ```


  #### Question 2.2: Department Buildout (Year 2-3)

  ```

  🏗️ **DEPARTMENT STRUCTURE - Years 2-3**


  Let's design how each department scales from Year 1 → Year 2 → Year 3.


  **ENGINEERING**


  | Role | Year 1 EOY | Year 2 EOY | Year 3 EOY |

  |------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

  | CTO | 1 | 1 | 1 |

  | Engineering Managers | 0 | 1-2 | 3-4 |

  | Senior Engineers | 2-3 | 5-7 | 10-15 |

  | Mid Engineers | 1-2 | 4-6 | 8-12 |

  | Junior Engineers | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4-6 |

  | QA/DevOps | 0 | 1-2 | 2-4 |

  | **TOTAL** | **[X]** | **[Y]** | **[Z]** |


  **Rationale**:

  - Year 1: Founders + 3-5 engineers (build MVP → PMF)

  - Year 2: Add manager layer when >8 engineers, hire QA/DevOps

  - Year 3: 2-3 teams (e.g., Platform, Features, Growth), EM for each


  {IF B2B}

  **SALES & GTM**


  | Role | Year 1 EOY | Year 2 EOY | Year 3 EOY |

  |------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

  | VP Sales | 0 | 1 | 1 |

  | Sales Managers | 0 | 0-1 | 2-3 |

  | Account Executives | 2-3 | 6-8 | 12-15 |

  | SDRs (Lead Gen) | 0-1 | 3-4 | 6-8 |

  | Sales Engineers | 0 | 1-2 | 2-4 |

  | **TOTAL** | **[X]** | **[Y]** | **[Z]** |


  **MARKETING**


  | Role | Year 1 EOY | Year 2 EOY | Year 3 EOY |

  |------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

  | Head of Marketing | 0-1 | 1 | 1 |

  | Demand Gen | 1 | 2-3 | 4-5 |

  | Content/SEO | 1 | 2 | 3-4 |

  | Product Marketing | 0 | 1 | 2 |

  | Designer | 0 (contract) | 1 | 2 |

  | **TOTAL** | **[X]** | **[Y]** | **[Z]** |


  **CUSTOMER SUCCESS / OPERATIONS**


  | Role | Year 1 EOY | Year 2 EOY | Year 3 EOY |

  |------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

  | Head of CS | 0 | 1 | 1 |

  | CSMs | 1-2 | 4-5 | 8-10 |

  | Support | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4-6 |

  | Ops / BizOps | 0 | 1 | 2-3 |

  | **TOTAL** | **[X]** | **[Y]** | **[Z]** |


  **G&A (Finance, HR, Legal)**


  | Role | Year 1 EOY | Year 2 EOY | Year 3 EOY |

  |------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

  | CFO / Finance Head | 0 | 0-1 | 1 |

  | Accountant | 0 (outsource) | 1 | 2 |

  | HR / Recruiting | 0 | 1 | 2-3 |

  | Legal / Compliance | 0 (contract) | 0-1 | 1 |

  | **TOTAL** | **[X]** | **[Y]** | **[Z]** |


  ---


  **TOTAL COMPANY HEADCOUNT**:

  - **Year 1**: [SUM] employees

  - **Year 2**: [SUM] employees

  - **Year 3**: [SUM] employees


  **Does this match your financial projections?**

  {IF MISMATCH}

  ⚠️ Your financial model says [X] headcount but this plan totals [Y]. Let's
  adjust...

  ```


  ### Section 3: Operating Model Choices


  #### Question 3.1: Remote vs Office vs Hybrid

  ```

  🏢 **OPERATING MODEL - Location Strategy**


  This choice affects:

  - Cost structure (office rent, equipment)

  - Talent pool (local vs global)

  - Company culture and productivity

  - Collaboration effectiveness


  **Option 1: Fully Remote**

  ✅ **Pros**:

  - Access global talent (hire best, not local)

  - Lower costs (no office rent, ₹5-10L/year saved)

  - Flexibility (attractive to top candidates)


  ❌ **Cons**:

  - Harder to build culture in early days

  - Communication overhead (async vs real-time)

  - Time zone challenges (if global team)


  **Best For**: Developer tools, global SaaS products, technical teams


  ---


  **Option 2: Office-First (Co-Located)**

  ✅ **Pros**:

  - Faster iteration (tap on shoulder > Slack thread)

  - Stronger culture and team bonding

  - Better for junior employees (mentorship)


  ❌ **Cons**:

  - Limited talent pool (one city only)

  - Office costs: ₹50K-₹3L/month depending on city and size

  - Less flexibility (some candidates will decline)


  **Best For**: Consumer products, sales-heavy orgs, early-stage (pre-PMF)


  ---


  **Option 3: Hybrid**

  ✅ **Pros**:

  - Balance of flexibility + in-person collaboration

  - Smaller office needed (hotdesking)

  - Retain local talent + hire remotely


  ❌ **Cons**:

  - Hardest to execute well (two-tier culture risk)

  - Need strong remote processes even with office

  - Office costs still present (but reduced)


  **Best For**: Post-PMF companies, sales teams local + eng remote


  ---


  **For YOUR business, I recommend**:


  {IF TEAM_SIZE < 10}

  **[OFFICE-FIRST]** because:

  - You're pre-PMF and need rapid iteration

  - Founders should be in-person with first 10 hires to build culture

  - Once you hit PMF (Year 2), reassess for remote expansion


  {IF TEAM_SIZE > 10 OR TECHNICAL_PRODUCT}

  **[HYBRID]** because:

  - Eng team can be remote (global talent)

  - Sales/GTM should be local to customers

  - Office for sales + exec team (10-15 people), eng distributed


  **Your operating model**: [RECOMMENDATION]


  Agree? Or do you have a strong preference?

  ```


  #### Question 3.2: Build vs Buy vs Outsource

  ```

  🛠️ **BUILD vs BUY vs OUTSOURCE - Core Functions**


  For each function, decide:

  - **Build (In-House)**: Hire full-time employees

  - **Buy (Tools/Platforms)**: Use SaaS products

  - **Outsource (Agencies)**: Contract specialists


  **FRAMEWORK**:


  | Function | Build if... | Buy if... | Outsource if... |

  |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|

  | **Engineering** | Core product | Not differentiating | Never (too risky) |

  | **Sales** | High ACV (>₹5L) | PLG/self-serve | Never (too core) |

  | **Marketing** | Build brand | Performance ads | Creative (design, video) |

  | **Customer Success** | High-touch B2B | Low-touch B2C | Never (retention is
  core) |

  | **HR/Recruiting** | >50 people | <50 people | Agencies for sourcing |

  | **Finance** | Post Series A | Pre Series A | Accounting, tax filing |

  | **Legal** | Regulated industry | Standard contracts | Everything except GC |

  | **IT/DevOps** | At scale (>100 employees) | Early stage | Managed services
  OK |

  ## 🔧 MCP Integration


  ```javascript

  // Auto-calculate total headcount from department breakdown

  ON_CHANGE: org_chart_year_X.departments[].headcount_eoy
    AUTO_CALCULATE:
      - org_chart_year_X.total_headcount_eoy = SUM(departments[].headcount_eoy)
      - Validate against financial_projections.projections.years_1_7[X].headcount_eoy

  // Auto-calculate hiring costs

  ON_CHANGE: hiring_plan.year_X_critical_hires[].annual_ctc
    AUTO_CALCULATE:
      - hiring_plan.total_hiring_cost.year_X = SUM(annual_ctc for all hires)
      - Validate against financial_projections.opex_breakdown.personnel_costs

  // Technology cost aggregation

  ON_CHANGE: technology_stack.*.monthly_cost_year_X
    AUTO_CALCULATE:
      - technology_stack.total_technology_spend.year_X_annual = SUM(monthly costs) × 12

  // Validate against financial model

  ON_CHANGE: ANY operations_plan field
    AUTO_VALIDATE:
      - Compare total personnel costs against financial model OPEX
      - Compare technology spend against financial model OPEX
      - Warn if >10% deviation
  ```


  ## ✅ Validation Rules


  ```javascript

  // Headcount consistency

  VALIDATE:
    org_chart_year_1.total_headcount_eoy === SUM(departments[].headcount_eoy)
    org_chart_year_2.total_headcount_eoy > org_chart_year_1.total_headcount_eoy
    org_chart_year_3.total_headcount_eoy > org_chart_year_2.total_headcount_eoy

  // Span of control (managers shouldn't have too many reports)

  WARN_IF:
    Any manager has >7 direct reports in Year 1
    Any manager has >10 direct reports in Year 2-3

  // Hiring velocity (can't hire too fast)

  WARN_IF:
    year_2_net_new_hires > year_1_total_headcount × 3  // Tripling headcount is risky
    year_3_net_new_hires > year_2_total_headcount × 2  // Doubling is max

  // Financial model alignment

  VALIDATE:
    total_hiring_cost.year_X within 20% of financial_projections.opex.personnel
    total_technology_spend.year_X within 20% of financial_projections.opex.software_tools

  // Critical role timing

  WARN_IF:
    B2B business with >₹2Cr revenue but no VP Sales hire planned
    Engineering team >10 people but no Engineering Manager hire planned
    Headcount >30 but no HR hire planned
  ```
