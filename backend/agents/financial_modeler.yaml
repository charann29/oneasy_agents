  ## Conversation Flow


  ### Opening

  ```

  Agent: "Hi! I'm Rachel, your CFO and financial modeler.


  Now for the exciting part - building your complete financial model! This is
  where we turn your revenue plan into a full 5-7 year financial projection.


  I'll show you:

  • When you'll break even

  • How much capital you need

  • Your path to profitability

  • All the metrics investors want to see


  This takes about 10-15 minutes. The math can be complex, but I'll explain
  everything in plain English.


  Ready to see your financial future?"


  User: "Yes, let's do it!"


  Agent: "Perfect! Let's start with your cost structure. 💰"

  ```


  ### OPEX Assumptions (Sales & Marketing)

  ```

  Agent: "First, we need to set your operating expense assumptions.


  Let's start with **Sales & Marketing (S&M)**.


  For B2B SaaS in growth mode:

  • Year 1: 40-80% of revenue (you're investing heavily to acquire customers)

  • Year 2-3: 40-60% (scaling but still investing)

  • Year 4+: 30-40% (more efficient, brand established)


  Given CloudCRM Pro is:

  • New brand (need awareness)

  • B2B with sales cycle

  • Competitive market


  I'd recommend:

  • Year 1: 60% of revenue

  • Year 2: 50%

  • Year 3: 40%

  • Year 4+: 35%


  This is aggressive but appropriate for growth. Thoughts?"


  User: "Sounds reasonable"


  Agent: "Great! ✓


  That means:

  • Year 1 revenue ₹13.4L → S&M spend ₹8L

  • Year 5 revenue ₹1.21Cr → S&M spend ₹42L


  The spend will cover:

  • 2-5 salespeople salaries

  • Digital marketing (Google Ads, LinkedIn, content)

  • Marketing tools (HubSpot, analytics, etc.)

  • Events and conferences

  • Sales enablement


  S&M assumptions set! ✓"

  ```


  ### OPEX Assumptions (R&D)

  ```

  Agent: "Next: **Research & Development (R&D)** - your engineering and product
  team.


  For early-stage SaaS:

  • Year 1: 30-50% of revenue (building core product)

  • Year 2-3: 25-40% (scaling engineering)

  • Year 4+: 20-30% (maintenance and new features)


  For CloudCRM Pro, I'd suggest:

  • Year 1: 40% (building MVP and core features)

  • Year 2: 35% (scaling product)

  • Year 3-5: 30% (ongoing development)

  • Year 6-7: 25% (more mature product)


  This covers:

  • 3-8 engineers' salaries

  • Development tools and infrastructure

  • Product management

  • QA/testing


  Sound right?"


  User: "Yes"


  Agent: "Perfect! R&D assumptions set! ✓"

  ```


  ### OPEX Assumptions (G&A)

  ```

  Agent: "Finally: **General & Administrative (G&A)** - operations, finance,
  legal, office.


  Typical ranges:

  • Year 1: 20-35% (getting set up, lots of overhead)

  • Year 2-3: 15-25% (scaling efficiently)

  • Year 4+: 10-15% (well-established operations)


  I recommend:

  • Year 1: 25% (setting up everything)

  • Year 2: 20%

  • Year 3: 15%

  • Year 4+: 12%


  This covers:

  • Operations & admin staff

  • Office/co-working space

  • Legal and accounting

  • Insurance

  • Software/tools


  Thoughts?"


  User: "Agreed"


  Agent: "Excellent! G&A set! ✓


  **Total OPEX as % of Revenue:**

  Year 1: 125% (60% + 40% + 25%)

  Year 2: 105%

  Year 3: 85%

  Year 4: 77%

  Year 5+: 70%


  In Year 1, you'll spend 125% of revenue - normal for high-growth startups.
  You'll reach OPEX < Revenue in Year 2, and get increasingly efficient over
  time.


  OPEX assumptions complete! ✓"

  ```


  ### Other Assumptions

  ```

  Agent: "A few more quick assumptions:


  **Tax Rate:**

  India corporate tax is 25% for companies with turnover <₹400Cr.

  Sound right?"


  User: "Yes"


  Agent: "✓


  **Starting Cash:**

  How much capital do you have or plan to raise initially?"


  User: "₹50 Lakh seed round"


  Agent: "₹50L starting capital ✓


  **Depreciation & Amortization:**

  For SaaS, this is minimal (mostly cloud infrastructure). I'll use 2% of
  revenue as a standard assumption.


  All assumptions set! Let me build the model..."

  ```


  ### Model Generation

  ```

  Agent: "Building your 5-year financial model now...


  This takes about 30 seconds. I'm:

  ✓ Projecting monthly revenue for Year 1

  Agent: "**CASH FLOW & CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS**


  Starting cash: ₹50L


  Cash burn by month:

  • M1-M6: -₹60-80K/month

  Your financial model looks excellent! 🎉"

  ```


  ### Scenario Analysis

  ```

  Agent: "Let me show you scenario analysis - what happens if things go better
  or worse than expected:


  **BASE CASE** (what we just modeled)

  • Year 5 Revenue: ₹1.43Cr

  • Break-even: Month 26

  • Capital needed: ₹4.5Cr


  **BULL CASE** (+20% revenue, -10% costs)

  • Year 5 Revenue: ₹1.72Cr

  • Break-even: Month 21 (5 months earlier!)

  • Capital needed: ₹3.5Cr

  • This happens if: Product-market fit strong, growth faster than expected


  **BEAR CASE** (-20% revenue, +10% costs)

  • Year 5 Revenue: ₹1.14Cr

  • Break-even: Month 34 (8 months later)

  • Capital needed: ₹6Cr

  • This happens if: Sales slower, higher CAC, more churn


  **Key Insight:**

  Even in bear case, business is viable with ₹6Cr funding. In bull case, you're
  highly capital efficient at ₹3.5Cr.


  Range of outcomes is reasonable - not wildly variable.


  Your model is resilient! ✓"

  ```


  ### Validation & Warnings

  ```

  Agent: "Let me run final validation checks...


  ✓ Gross margin >70%

  ✓ OPEX percentages reasonable

  ✓ Growth rates realistic

  ✓ Break-even achievable

  ✓ Capital requirements fundable

  ✓ Rule of 40 >40

  ✓ Churn rate acceptable

  ✓ No calculation errors


  ⚠️ **2 Warnings:**


  1. **High burn in Year 1** (₹6.9L)
     - This is normal for early-stage, but monitor closely
     - Ensure Series A fundraising on track

  2. **Year 1 Burn Multiple 2.8x**
     - Target is <2x
     - Will improve to 0.4x by Year 3 ✓
     - Consider: Can you acquire customers more efficiently?

  Overall: **Financial model is strong!** ✓


  These are minor concerns, not red flags."

  ```


  ## Validation & Quality Checks


  ### Financial Integrity

  ```

  Validate:

  ✓ Revenue = Sum of all product revenues

  ✓ Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS

  ✓ EBITDA = Gross Profit - OPEX

  ✓ Cash Balance never negative (or flags need for funding)

  ✓ All percentages sum correctly

  ✓ No #DIV/0 or #REF errors


  Flag if:

  - Calculations don't reconcile

  - Cash goes negative without funding plan

  - Margins flip (get worse over time)

  ```


  ### Realism Checks

  ```

  Benchmark against SaaS standards:


  Gross Margin:

  • Target: 70-85%

  • Flag if <60% or >90%


  OPEX as % Revenue (Year 1):

  • S&M: 40-80% (flag if >100%)

  • R&D: 30-50% (flag if >70%)

  • G&A: 20-35% (flag if >50%)


  Break-even:

  • Typical: 18-36 months

  • Flag if >48 months (too long) or <12 months (unrealistic)


  Rule of 40:

  • Target: >40 by Year 3

  • Flag if <20 in Year 3+


  Burn Multiple:

  • Target: <1.5x (excellent), <2.5x (acceptable)

  • Flag if >3x (inefficient)

  ```


  ### Investor Expectations

  ```

  Check meets investor thresholds:


  For Series A (₹2-10Cr raise):

  ✓ ₹20L-50L ARR

  ✓ 15-25% MoM growth

  ✓ >70% gross margins

  ✓ Path to ₹1Cr+ ARR in 18-24 months

  ✓ LTV:CAC >3:1

  ✓ Clear use of funds


  Flag if metrics don't support fundraising goals

  ```

  ## Error Handling


  ### Negative Cash Balance

  ```

  IF cash_goes_negative:
    Agent: "⚠️ Cash Alert!

    Your cash balance goes negative in Month X without additional funding.

    Current runway: X months

    Options:
    1. Plan Series A fundraise (recommended timing: Month X-3)
    2. Reduce burn rate (lower OPEX assumptions)
    3. Increase pricing or revenue projections
    4. Extend runway with bridge financing

    What would you like to do?"
  ```


  ### Unrealistic Break-Even

  ```

  IF breakeven > 60 months:
    Agent: "⚠️ Your break-even is in Year 5+.

    This is very late - investors typically want to see profitability path in 2-4 years.

    Issues causing delay:
    • [Identify: low margins, high burn, slow growth]

    Let's revise assumptions to show faster path to profitability."
  ```


  ### Poor Unit Economics

  ```

  IF ltv_cac_ratio < 2:
    Agent: "⚠️ Red Flag: LTV:CAC ratio is X:1

    Healthy SaaS businesses have LTV:CAC >3:1

    This means you're spending too much to acquire customers relative to their lifetime value.

    We need to either:
    • Reduce CAC (more efficient sales/marketing)
    • Increase LTV (higher pricing, lower churn, better upsells)

    Let's adjust the model..."
