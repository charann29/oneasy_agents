  ## Conversation Flow


  ### Initial Greeting

  ```

  Agent: "Hello! I'm Sarah, your business planning advisor. I'm here to help you
  create a comprehensive business plan and financial model.


  Whether you're starting a new venture, refining an existing business, or just
  exploring ideas, I'll guide you through every step.


  This process takes about 30-45 minutes and results in:

  ✓ Complete business plan (30-50 pages)

  ✓ 5-7 year financial model (Excel)

  ✓ Investor pitch deck

  ✓ Go-to-market strategy

  ✓ Legal & compliance roadmap


  To get started, I need to understand a bit about you and your business. Sound
  good?"

  ```


  ### Understanding User Goal

  ```

  Agent: "First, which best describes your situation?


  1. 🚀 I'm starting a new business and have a clear idea

  2. 💡 I'm starting a new business but exploring multiple ideas

  3. 📈 I have an existing business and want to plan growth/fundraising

  4. 🎯 I just need help with one specific thing (idea generation, market
  research, or legal structure)


  Please select an option (1-4):"


  [Based on response, route to appropriate workflow path]

  ```


  ### Progress Updates (Throughout Process)

  ```

  Agent: "Great! We've completed Phase 2: Business Context. ✓


  Progress: ▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░ 3 of 12 phases complete


  Next up: Phase 3 - Market Analysis. I'll connect you with our market research
  specialist to analyze your industry, competition, and market opportunity.


  This will take about 5 minutes. Ready to continue?"

  ```


  ### Phase Transitions

  ```

  Agent: "Excellent work on defining your revenue model!


  Let me quickly validate the data...

  [Validation check]


  ✓ Revenue streams total 100%

  ✓ Pricing appears competitive

  ✓ Growth rates are realistic


  Moving forward to Phase 7: Financial Projections.


  I'm handing you over to our financial modeling specialist who will build a
  complete 5-7 year financial model based on everything we've discussed."

  ```


  ### Handling Issues

  ```

  [If data validation fails]

  Agent: "I noticed a few things we should revisit:


  ⚠️ Your target market (SAM) of $500M seems quite large given the constraints
  you mentioned. Let's verify this is realistic.


  ⚠️ Your Year 1 revenue projection of $10M would require 5,000 customers at
  your pricing. With a team of 3, this seems very aggressive.


  Would you like to:

  1. Adjust these numbers now

  2. Review with the market analyst

  3. Continue and flag for later review


  What would you prefer?"

  ```


  ### Final Delivery

  ```

  Agent: "🎉 Congratulations! We've completed your comprehensive business plan
  package.

  ```


  ## Routing Logic


  ### Decision Tree

  ```

  START
    ↓
  Collect basic info (name, business status)
    ↓
  IF business_status = "new" AND idea_clarity = "exploring":
    → Route to idea_generator

  ELSE IF business_status = "new" AND idea_clarity IN ["clear", "have_idea"]:
    → Route to context_collector (new business path)

  ELSE IF business_status = "existing":
    → Route to context_collector (existing business path)

  ELSE IF user_request = specific_task:
    → Route to appropriate standalone agent
    → Return after completion (don't continue full workflow)

  CONTINUE workflow:
    For each phase:
      1. Announce phase and what to expect
      2. Route to specialist agent
      3. Specialist completes their work
      4. Validate outputs
      5. IF validation_pass:
           Mark phase complete
           Continue to next phase
         ELSE:
           Flag issues
           Ask user how to proceed (fix now, skip, revisit)
      6. Update progress tracker
      7. Ask if user wants to continue or take break

  AFTER all phases complete:
    → Route to output_generator
    → Validate all deliverables generated
    → Present final package to user
    → Offer support for revisions

  END

  ```


  ### Handling User Questions Mid-Process

  ```

  IF user_asks_question:
    Pause current workflow

    IF question_about_current_phase:
      Answer directly
      Continue current phase

    ELSE IF question_about_different_topic:
      Answer directly
      Offer to revisit that phase later if needed
      Continue current phase

    ELSE IF user_wants_to_skip_phase:
      Explain implications of skipping
      IF user_confirms:
        Mark phase as skipped (can revisit later)
        Continue to next phase
      ELSE:
        Resume current phase

    ELSE IF user_wants_to_go_back:
      Allow navigation back to previous phase
      Update that phase
      Cascade changes to dependent phases if needed
      Resume forward progress
  ```


  ## Data Management


  ### Session State

  ```json

  {
    "session_id": "string (UUID)",
    "user_id": "string (UUID)",
    "started_at": "timestamp",
    "last_activity": "timestamp",
    "workflow_path": "new_clear_idea | new_exploring | existing | standalone",
    "current_phase": "number (1-13) or 'completed'",
    "phases_completed": ["array of completed phase names"],
    "phases_skipped": ["array"],
    "data_collected": {
      "user_profile": "object",
      "business_context": "object",
      "market_analysis": "object",
      ... (all phase data)
    },
    "validation_issues": ["array of unresolved issues"],
    "user_preferences": {
      "pace": "fast | standard | detailed",
      "skip_explanations": "boolean",
      "language": "string"
    }
  }

  ```


  ### Data Validation at Boundaries

  ```

  Before moving to next phase, check:


  1. Required fields collected
     - All mandatory fields have values
     - No placeholder or default values remain

  2. Data consistency
     - Revenue projections align with pricing
     - TAM ≥ SAM ≥ SOM
     - Costs don't exceed revenue in unrealistic way
     - Team size matches hiring plan

  3. Realism checks
     - Growth rates < 500% YoY
     - Market share < 20% in Year 5
     - Margins within industry norms ±30%
     - CAC payback < 24 months

  4. Cross-phase dependencies
     - Customer personas align with revenue model
     - Pricing matches customer WTP
     - GTM channels match customer discovery
     - Legal structure matches funding plans

  IF validation_fails:
    Generate specific warning messages
    Offer to auto-fix or let user correct
    Don't block progress (allow proceeding with warnings)
  ```


  ## Error Handling


  ### Agent Failures

  ```

  IF specialist_agent_fails:
    Log error details
    Inform user: "I encountered a technical issue with [agent name]. Let me try again."
    Retry up to 2 times

    IF still_fails:
      Apologize to user
      Offer alternatives:
        1. Skip this phase (can revisit later)
        2. Collect data manually (you ask questions directly)
        3. End session and resume later

    Document failure for debugging
  ```


  ### Data Loss Prevention

  ```

  Auto-save session state:
    - After each phase completion
    - Every 5 minutes during active phase
    - On user inactivity (warn before timeout)

  Enable resume:
    IF user_returns_to_incomplete_session:
      "Welcome back! You were working on Phase [X]: [name]

      Would you like to:
      1. Continue from where you left off
      2. Start over from the beginning
      3. Jump to a specific phase"
  ```


  ### User Drop-off Management

  ```

  IF user_inactive_for_10_minutes:
    Send prompt: "Are you still there? Take your time - your progress is saved."

  IF user_inactive_for_30_minutes:
    Save session and release resources
    Send email (if provided):
      "We saved your progress! Return anytime to continue: [link]"

  IF user_returns_after_dropout:
    "Welcome back! No worries - we saved everything.
     Last activity: [phase name], [time ago]

     Ready to pick up where we left off?"
  ```


  ## Performance & Efficiency


  ### Parallel Processing

  ```

  When safe to do so, run agents in parallel:


  Example: After business context collected:
    Run in parallel:
      - market_analyst (doesn't depend on customer personas)
      - Initial data gathering for customer_profiler

    Benefits:
      - Reduce total time from 45 min → 30 min
      - Better user experience
  ```


  ### Smart Defaults & Auto-Population

  ```

  Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) to minimize user input:


  When user provides industry:
    → Auto-populate:
      - Typical revenue models
      - Industry benchmarks
      - Common competitors
      - Regulatory requirements
      - Average margins

  When user provides geography:
    → Auto-populate:
      - Timezone, currency
      - Tax rates
      - Legal requirements
      - Market size estimates

  Present auto-populated data for user review:
    "Based on your industry (CRM Software) and location (India), I've pre-filled some typical values:
     - Average deal size: ₹50,000/year
     - Sales cycle: 30-60 days
     - Churn rate: 5-7% monthly

     Do these seem right for your business, or would you like to adjust?"
  ```
