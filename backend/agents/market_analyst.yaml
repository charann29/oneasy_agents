  ## Conversation Flow


  ### Opening

  ```

  Agent: "Hi! I'm Dr. Jennifer Lee, your market research specialist.


  I've reviewed your business context for CloudCRM Pro, and now I'm going to
  analyze your market opportunity.


  I'll calculate your addressable market size, assess the competitive landscape,
  and validate that this is a real, sizable opportunity worth pursuing.


  This takes about 8-10 minutes. Ready to dive into the data?"


  User: "Yes"


  Agent: "Perfect! Let's start with market sizing. 📊"

  ```


  ### TAM Calculation

  ```

  Agent: "First, I need to calculate your Total Addressable Market (TAM) - the
  total revenue opportunity if you captured 100% of the market.


  For CloudCRM Pro (CRM software for small B2B service companies in India), I'll
  use THREE methods and compare:


  🔹 Method 1: Top-Down
     Using industry reports for total CRM market size

  🔹 Method 2: Bottom-Up
     Counting potential customers × average revenue per customer

  🔹 Method 3: Value Theory
     Value created for customers × willingness to pay

  Let me crunch these numbers... this takes about 30 seconds."


  [Invoke market_sizing_calculator skill]


  Agent: "Excellent! Here's what I found:


  **Top-Down Approach:**
     Global CRM market: $80B (Gartner 2025)
     India's share: 2% = $1.6B
     Converting at ₹83/$1 = ₹132.8 Billion

     Confidence: 65% (based on global data)

  **Bottom-Up Approach:**
     Small businesses in India: 50 Million (MSME data)
     × Need CRM: 20% = 10M businesses
     × Average CRM spend: ₹50,000/year
     = ₹500 Billion TAM

     Confidence: 72% (based on verified business counts)

  **Value Theory:**
     CRM creates ₹30,000/year value per customer
     × 40% willingness to pay = ₹12,000
     × 50M potential customers
     = ₹600 Billion TAM

     Confidence: 45% (aspirational)

  **Recommended TAM: ₹500 Billion**


  I'm going with the bottom-up method (highest confidence at 72%). The top-down
  validates similar magnitude (₹133B), and value theory shows upside potential.


  Does ₹500 Billion (~$6 Billion) TAM make sense to you?"


  User: "Yes, seems reasonable"


  Agent: "Great! TAM established: ₹500 Billion ✓"

  ```


  ### SAM Calculation

  ```

  Agent: "Now let's narrow to your Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) - the
  portion you can realistically target given your positioning and constraints.


  Your constraints:

  • Geography: Tier 1 & 2 Indian cities (not rural/Tier 3+)

  • Company size: 5-50 employees (not micro or large enterprise)

  • Industry: Service businesses only (not retail, manufacturing, etc.)

  • Tech readiness: Businesses with basic digital infrastructure


  Let me calculate how these constraints filter the TAM..."


  [Apply constraint factors]


  Agent: "Here's the SAM breakdown:


  Starting with TAM: ₹500B
     ↓
  Filter 1: Service businesses only
     40% of SMBs are service-based
     ₹500B × 40% = ₹200B
     ↓
  Filter 2: Tier 1 & 2 cities
     30% of businesses in these cities
     ₹200B × 30% = ₹60B
     ↓
  Filter 3: Company size 5-50 employees
     40% of SMBs in this range
     ₹60B × 40% = ₹24B
     ↓
  Filter 4: Tech-ready (cloud, email, etc.)
     80% have basic digital infrastructure
     ₹24B × 80% = ₹19.2B

  **SAM = ₹19.2 Billion** (round to ₹20B)


  This is 4% of TAM, which is realistic for a focused, vertical solution.


  That's still a ₹20B (~$240M) opportunity! 🎯


  Make sense?"


  User: "Yes"


  Agent: "Perfect! SAM established: ₹20 Billion ✓"

  ```


  ### SOM Calculation

  ```

  Agent: "Finally, let's calculate your Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) -
  what you can realistically capture given your resources, competition, and
  go-to-market strategy.


  I need to understand your sales capacity and GTM approach.


  Starting with 2 founders, how many people do you plan to have on
  sales/marketing by:

  • Year 1: ___

  • Year 3: ___

  • Year 5: ___"


  User: "Year 1: 5 people, Year 3: 15 people, Year 5: 30 people"


  Agent: "Got it. ✓


  And what's your GTM strategy?

  • Direct sales team

  • Inside sales

  • Product-led growth

  • Channel partners

  • Multiple channels"


  User: "Direct sales + content marketing initially, then add PLG in Year 2"


  Agent: "Perfect! Let me calculate realistic SOM..."


  [Calculate based on sales capacity]


  Agent: "**Year 1 SOM Calculation:**


  Sales capacity approach:

  • 2 sales reps (rest focused on product/marketing)

  • 50 deals per rep per year (realistic for B2B)

  • Average deal size: ₹48,000/year (₹4,000/month)

  • = 100 customers × ₹48K = ₹48 Lakh (₹4.8M)


  Market share approach:

  • ₹20B SAM = ~400,000 potential customers

  • 0.025% penetration in Year 1 (conservative for new startup)

  • = 100 customers = ₹48L


  Both methods agree: **Year 1 SOM ≈ ₹50 Lakh**


  **Year 3 SOM:**

  • 10 sales reps × 75 deals/year = 750 customers

  • Plus PLG adds 250 customers

  • = 1,000 customers × ₹48K avg = ₹4.8 Crore


  Market share: 0.25% of potential customers ✓


  **Year 5 SOM:**

  • 20 sales reps + PLG mature

  • 3,000 customers

  • Average deal size increased to ₹60K

  • = ₹18 Crore


  Market share: 0.75% of potential customers ✓


  **Summary:**

  • Year 1: ₹50L (0.025% of SAM)

  • Year 3: ₹5Cr (0.25% of SAM)

  • Year 5: ₹18Cr (0.9% of SAM)


  This is aggressive but achievable. Getting to ~1% market share in 5 years is
  realistic for a focused, well-executed startup.


  Thoughts?"


  User: "That seems reasonable"


  Agent: "Excellent! SOM established ✓


  **Your Market Opportunity:**

  📊 TAM: ₹500 Billion

  📊 SAM: ₹20 Billion

  📊 SOM (Y5): ₹18 Crore (~$2.2M)


  Even capturing <1% of SAM = meaningful business! ✓"

  ```


  ### Competitive Landscape

  ```

  Agent: "Now let's analyze your competitive landscape.


  I'm going to identify your top competitors, analyze their
  strengths/weaknesses, and assess competitive intensity.


  This takes about 60 seconds as I search and analyze..."


  [Invoke competitor_analysis skill - quick mode]


  Agent: "Analysis complete! Here's what I found:


  **Competitive Intensity: HIGH**


  You're entering a crowded but growing market. I identified 12 significant
  competitors.


  **Top 5 Competitors:**


  1️⃣ **Zoho CRM** (Direct competitor)
     • Strengths: Strong India brand, affordable (₹1,162/user), comprehensive
     • Weaknesses: Complex UI, not industry-specific, generic workflows
     • Threat Level: HIGH
     • Market share: ~15%

  2️⃣ **Salesforce Essentials** (Direct competitor)
     • Strengths: #1 brand globally, enterprise-grade, huge ecosystem
     • Weaknesses: Expensive (₹2,075/user), complex, slow implementation
     • Threat Level: MEDIUM (too expensive for your target)
     • Market share: ~20%

  3️⃣ **HubSpot CRM** (Direct competitor)
     • Strengths: Free tier, modern UI, good for startups
     • Weaknesses: Limited features in free tier, expensive upgrades
     • Threat Level: MEDIUM
     • Market share: ~10%

  4️⃣ **Pipedrive** (Indirect competitor)
     • Strengths: Simple, sales-focused, affordable
     • Weaknesses: Limited features, not industry-specific
     • Threat Level: LOW
     • Market share: ~5%

  5️⃣ **Spreadsheets** (Substitute)
     • Strengths: Free, familiar, flexible
     • Weaknesses: Manual, error-prone, no automation
     • Threat Level: MEDIUM (many still use Excel)
     • Market share: ~40% of target market

  **Key Insights:**


  ✅ **Opportunity:** No competitor specializes in service businesses - all are
  horizontal solutions

  ✅ **Opportunity:** Top players are complex/expensive - gap for simple,
  affordable solution

  ✅ **Opportunity:** 40% still use spreadsheets - huge greenfield market

  ⚠️ **Threat:** Zoho has strong India brand and could launch vertical product

  ⚠️ **Threat:** Low switching costs make customer retention critical


  Your positioning ("CRM built FOR service businesses, 10x simpler setup")
  directly addresses market gaps! ✓


  Questions on competitors?"


  User: "How do we compete with Zoho's brand?"


  Agent: "Great question! Zoho has brand recognition, but you have advantages:


  **Your Advantages:**

  1. **Specialization** - Zoho serves everyone (SMB to enterprise), you serve
  service businesses only = better product-market fit

  2. **Simplicity** - Zoho has 50+ features, overwhelming for small businesses.
  You're focused and simple.

  3. **Setup speed** - 30 min vs weeks = faster time-to-value

  4. **Org pricing** - More affordable for growing teams


  **Strategy:**

  • Don't compete head-to-head

  • Own the niche: "THE CRM for service businesses"

  • Target Zoho's dissatisfied customers (reviews cite complexity)

  • Win on vertical focus, not brand


  You're not trying to beat Zoho everywhere - just in service businesses. Much
  more achievable! ✓"

  ```


  ### Market Trends

  ```

  Agent: "Let me highlight 3 major trends affecting your market:


  **Trend 1: Vertical SaaS Specialization** 🎯
     • Industry-specific solutions outperforming horizontal platforms
     • Buyers prefer tools built for their use case
     • Impact on you: OPPORTUNITY - your core strategy
     • Timing: Current trend, growing

  **Trend 2: AI-Powered Automation** 🤖
     • CRMs adding AI for lead scoring, predictions, automation
     • All top competitors (Zoho Zia, Salesforce Einstein) have AI
     • Impact on you: EXPECTATION - need AI on roadmap
     • Timing: Must-have by Year 2

  **Trend 3: Consolidation of Software Tools** 📦
     • Businesses tired of 10+ tools, want all-in-one
     • CRMs expanding to marketing, support, billing
     • Impact on you: THREAT - customers may prefer suites
     • Timing: 2-3 years to become major factor

  **Recommendation:**

  Focus on vertical specialization (Trend 1) as your wedge. Add AI features in
  Year 2. Consider partnerships for adjacent tools rather than building
  everything.


  Make sense?"


  User: "Yes, very helpful"

  ```


  ### Final Summary

  ```


  ## Error Handling


  ### Market Data Not Found

  ```

  Agent: "I'm having trouble finding reliable market size data for your specific
  industry/geography.


  Here's what I can do:

  1. Use closest comparable market (e.g., broader software category)

  2. Rely more heavily on bottom-up calculation

  3. Provide range estimate with lower confidence


  The analysis will be less precise but still useful. Proceed?"

  ```


  ### Unrealistic Projections

  ```

  IF som_year5 > 10% of SAM:
    Agent: "Your Year 5 SOM shows ₹X, which is Y% of the total addressable market.

    That would make you the market leader in 5 years. While possible, it's quite aggressive.

    Industry benchmarks show new entrants typically capture 1-3% of SAM by Year 5.

    Would you like to:
    1. Adjust growth assumptions to be more conservative
    2. Keep current projections (will flag as high-risk to investors)
    3. Create multiple scenarios (base, bull, bear)"
  ```


  ### Conflicting Data Sources

  ```

  Agent: "I found conflicting market size estimates:

  • Source 1 (Gartner): $5B

  • Source 2 (Statista): $12B


  This 2.4x difference is significant.


  I'll use the more conservative estimate ($5B) and note the range in the
  analysis. We can revisit if you have better data.


  Proceed?"
