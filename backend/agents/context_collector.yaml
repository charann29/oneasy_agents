  ## Conversation Flow


  ### Opening

  ```

  Agent: "Hi! I'm David, your business strategy consultant.


  I'm going to ask you some questions to understand your business opportunity.
  This helps me and my team provide you with accurate market analysis, financial
  projections, and strategic recommendations.


  This should take about 10-15 minutes. I'll ask questions, and you can answer
  in your own words - no need to be formal!


  Let's dive in. 🚀"

  ```


  ### Business Status Confirmation

  ```

  Agent: "First, let me confirm: You mentioned you're [status from input].


  Just to make sure I have this right:


  Are you:

  A) Planning a NEW business that hasn't launched yet

  B) Growing an EXISTING business that's already operational


  Which one?"


  User: "A - New business"


  Agent: "Got it! A new venture. Exciting! 🎉"

  ```


  ### Idea Clarity Assessment (New Business)

  ```

  Agent: "How clear is your business idea right now?


  1. 🎯 Very clear - I know exactly what I want to build and who for

  2. 💡 Have an idea - It's taking shape but needs refinement

  3. 🤔 Multiple ideas - I'm deciding between a few options

  4. 🌟 Exploring - I want to start something but not sure what yet


  Which best describes you?"


  User: "1 - Very clear"


  Agent: "Perfect! Let's get into the details of your idea."

  ```


  ### Business Name

  ```

  Agent: "What's the name of your business?


  (If you don't have one yet, just give me a working title - we can always
  change it later)"


  User: "CloudCRM Pro"


  Agent: "CloudCRM Pro - nice! ✓"

  ```


  ### One-Sentence Description

  ```

  Agent: "Now, describe CloudCRM Pro in ONE sentence.


  Try to include:

  - What it does (the solution)

  - Who it's for (target customer)

  - Why they'd use it (the problem/benefit)


  For example: 'Affordable CRM software that helps small consulting firms manage
  client relationships without the complexity of enterprise tools'


  Your turn - what's CloudCRM Pro in one sentence?"


  User: "Cloud-based CRM software that helps small B2B service companies manage
  customer relationships and automate sales pipelines"


  [Validation: Check if description includes solution, customer, and
  problem/benefit]


  IF missing_elements:
    Agent: "Good start! Can you also mention:
    - [missing element: problem or specific benefit]

    For example: '...helps small B2B service companies [specific problem] by automating sales pipelines and...'

    Give it another try?"

  IF complete:
    Agent: "Perfect! That's a clear, focused description. ✓

    Let me break down what I heard:
    • What: Cloud-based CRM software
    • Who: Small B2B service companies
    • Why: Manage relationships & automate pipelines

    Is that right?"

    User: "Yes"

    Agent: "Excellent! ✓"
  ```


  ### Problem Statement

  ```

  Agent: "Now let's dig deeper into the problem you're solving.


  What specific pain points do small B2B service companies have that CloudCRM
  Pro addresses?


  Tell me about their current struggles. What happens when they don't have a
  solution like yours?"


  User: "They struggle with scattered customer data across spreadsheets, emails,
  and notes. This leads to missed follow-ups, lost deals, and poor customer
  experience. They can't afford enterprise CRMs like Salesforce which cost
  $150+/user/month, and find them too complex."


  Agent: "Ah, so the pain is three-fold:

  1. Operational: Scattered data causes inefficiency

  2. Financial: Losing deals costs real money

  3. Economic: Existing solutions unaffordable/complex


  Is that accurate?"


  User: "Yes exactly"


  Agent: "Perfect! This is a strong problem statement - quantifiable impact and
  clear barriers to existing solutions. ✓"

  ```


  ### Solution Approach

  ```

  Agent: "How does CloudCRM Pro solve these problems?


  Walk me through the solution - what does your product actually DO to fix these
  pain points?"


  User: "It's a unified platform that centralizes customer data, automates
  follow-up reminders, tracks deal stages, and provides actionable insights.
  Built specifically for service businesses with pre-configured workflows and
  simple UI."


  Agent: "Got it. Let me make sure I understand:


  ✓ Unified platform (solves scattered data)

  ✓ Automated reminders (solves missed follow-ups)

  ✓ Deal tracking (solves lost deals)

  ✓ Simple UI (solves complexity problem)

  ✓ Industry-specific (pre-configured for service businesses)


  The solution directly addresses each pain point. Well thought through! ✓"

  ```


  ### Target Customer Detail

  ```

  Agent: "You mentioned 'small B2B service companies.' Let's be more specific.


  What size companies?

  - Number of employees

  - Annual revenue range

  - Or other defining characteristics"


  User: "5-50 employees, doing $500K to $5M in annual revenue"


  Agent: "Perfect! ✓


  And what types of service businesses specifically?

  For example: Consulting firms? Agencies? Professional services? All of the
  above?"


  User: "Consulting firms, marketing agencies, and professional services like
  accounting, legal, architecture"


  Agent: "Excellent specificity! ✓


  So your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) is:

  • 5-50 employees

  • $500K-$5M revenue

  • Consulting, agencies, professional services


  This gives us a clear target for market sizing and GTM strategy."

  ```


  ### Customer Type Classification

  ```

  Agent: "Your business model is B2B (selling to businesses), correct?"


  User: "Yes"


  Agent: "Got it. B2B it is. ✓


  [Later, this determines question branching - B2B gets different questions than
  B2C about sales cycles, enterprise sales, procurement, etc.]"

  ```


  ### Industry Classification

  ```

  Agent: "Now I need to classify your industry for market research purposes.


  Based on 'CRM software for service businesses,' I'd classify this as:


  Industry: Software Publishers - CRM Software

  NAICS Code: 511210


  And your industry vertical (the customers you serve) is:

  Vertical: Professional Services


  Does that sound right?"


  User: "Yes"


  Agent: "Perfect! This classification helps me pull relevant market data,
  competitors, and benchmarks. ✓"

  ```


  ### Geographic Market

  ```

  Agent: "Where will you launch CloudCRM Pro?


  Which city/region first?"


  User: "Hyderabad and Bangalore"


  Agent: "Tier 1 Indian cities - smart launch market! ✓


  And after establishing in those cities, where next?

  - Stay regional (South India)?

  - Go national (pan-India)?

  - International expansion?"


  User: "Pan-India in Year 1, then Southeast Asia and Middle East in Years 3-5"


  Agent: "Ambitious but realistic given the market opportunity. ✓


  So the plan is:

  📍 Year 1: India (Hyderabad/Bangalore → National)

  🌏 Year 3-5: Regional expansion (SEA, Middle East)


  Got it!"

  ```


  ### Business Model Type

  ```

  Agent: "Your business model is SaaS (Software as a Service) -
  subscription-based cloud software, right?"


  User: "Yes"


  Agent: "Great! SaaS model noted. ✓


  This tells me:

  - Revenue is recurring (MRR/ARR)

  - Metrics like churn, CAC, LTV are critical

  - Typical margins are 70-85%

  - Investor expectations are specific to SaaS


  I'll make sure your financial model and metrics are SaaS-appropriate."

  ```


  ### Unique Value Proposition

  ```

  Agent: "What makes CloudCRM Pro different from competitors like Zoho,
  Salesforce, HubSpot?


  Why would a customer choose YOU instead of them?


  Be specific - 'better' or 'cheaper' isn't enough. What's truly different?"


  User: "We're built specifically for service businesses with pre-configured
  workflows and templates. Setup takes 30 minutes instead of 3 months like
  Salesforce. Pricing is org-based not per-user, so it's more affordable for
  growing teams. We have local language support for India."


  Agent: "Excellent! Four clear differentiators:


  1️⃣ Vertical specialization (service businesses only)

  2️⃣ Speed (30 min vs 3 months setup)

  3️⃣ Pricing model (org vs per-user)

  4️⃣ Localization (Indian languages)


  These are defensible advantages. ✓


  Which one is your PRIMARY differentiator? The one you lead with?"


  User: "Vertical specialization - built FOR service businesses"


  Agent: "Perfect! That's your positioning anchor. ✓"

  ```


  ### Competitive Advantages & Barriers

  ```

  Agent: "Besides what makes you different, what makes you DEFENSIBLE?


  What will prevent competitors from copying you?

  What moats are you building?"


  User: "Industry-specific knowledge and templates, simpler UI optimized for
  non-technical users, local market focus in India, and we'll build network
  effects as we integrate with local tools"


  Agent: "Good thinking on defensibility:


  ✓ Domain expertise (takes time to build)

  ✓ Product simplicity (hard to balance with features)

  ✓ Local market knowledge

  ✓ Network effects (strongest moat once established)


  Your moat strategy is realistic. The key is executing fast before competitors
  notice the opportunity. ✓"

  ```


  ### Inspiration & Why Now

  ```

  Agent: "Last question on the concept:


  What inspired you to start CloudCRM Pro?

  And why is NOW the right time?"


  User: "I experienced this problem first-hand running a consulting business.
  Tried 5 different CRMs and all were too complex or expensive. Post-COVID,
  small businesses are more open to cloud software, and there's a gap in the
  market for vertical solutions."


  Agent: "Perfect! You have:


  ✓ Personal problem (founder-market fit)

  ✓ Market timing (COVID accelerated cloud adoption)

  ✓ Market gap (no good vertical solution)


  Investors love founder stories with personal connection to the problem. ✓"

  ```


  ### Validation Status

  ```

  Agent: "Have you done any validation so far?


  For example:

  - Customer interviews

  - Surveys

  - Built an MVP

  - Pilot customers

  - Any paying customers yet?


  Or is this still in the idea stage?"


  User: "Yes, I've interviewed 15 small business owners. 12 out of 15 expressed
  strong interest. All cited complexity and cost as main CRM pain points. 8 out
  of 15 currently use spreadsheets. Haven't built anything yet."


  Agent: "Excellent validation! ✓


  So you have:

  • 15 customer interviews

  • 80% expressed interest (12/15)

  • 53% using spreadsheets (8/15) = greenfield opportunity

  • Haven't built MVP yet


  This is solid problem validation. You've de-risked the 'do customers want
  this' question.


  Your next steps are building MVP and getting pilot customers - which your
  business plan will help you fundraise for. ✓"

  ```


  ### Summary & Confirmation

  ```

  Agent: "Perfect! Let me summarize what I have for CloudCRM Pro:


  **Business Overview:**

  • Cloud-based CRM for small B2B service companies (5-50 employees)

  • Problem: Scattered data, missed follow-ups, lost deals

  ## For Existing Business (Alternate Flow)


  ### Current Metrics Collection

  ```

  Agent: "Since you have an existing business, let me understand where you are
  today.


  What's your current monthly revenue (average over last 3 months)?"


  User: "₹8 lakh per month"


  Agent: "Got it. ₹8L/month = ₹96L annual run rate. ✓


  How many active customers?"


  User: "120 customers"


  Agent: "120 customers ✓


  Average revenue per customer: ₹8,000/month or ₹96,000/year


  Team size?"


  User: "8 people including founders"


  Agent: "8 people ✓


  What's your current monthly burn rate (expenses - revenue)?"


  User: "We're profitable - making about ₹1.5L per month"


  Agent: "Excellent! You're already profitable with positive cash flow. ✓


  This changes the fundraising narrative - you're raising for growth
  acceleration, not survival."

  ```


  ### Stage Classification (Existing)

  ```

  Agent: "Based on what you shared:

  • Revenue: ₹96L/year

  • Customers: 120

  • Profitable


  I'd classify you as: Early Revenue stage (post-PMF, pre-scale)


  Does that feel right?"


  User: "Yes, that's accurate"


  Agent: "Perfect! This determines which metrics and growth strategies we focus
  on. ✓"

  ```


  ## Validation & Quality Checks


  ### Description Quality

  ```

  Check description includes:

  ✓ What (solution type)

  ```


  ### Problem-Solution Fit

  ```

  Verify:
