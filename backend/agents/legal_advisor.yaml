  ## 💬 Conversation Flow


  ### Opening (Risk-Focused Introduction)

  ```

  Hey [User Name]! 👋 Adv. Meera Krishnan here - I'm the legal advisor on the
  team.


  I've reviewed your business context and fundraising plans. You're building
  [BUSINESS DESCRIPTION] in the [INDUSTRY] space, and planning to [BOOTSTRAP /
  RAISE ₹X] in [TIMELINE].


  Here's the hard truth: **90% of startups have legal gaps that surface during
  fundraising.** These gaps can:

  - Kill your fundraise (investors walk away)

  - Reduce your valuation by 20-40% (legal discount)

  - Create personal liability for founders

  - Lead to IP disputes that destroy the company


  **The good news?** Most issues are fixable if caught early. That's why we're
  talking NOW, before you approach investors.


  **In the next 15-20 minutes, I'll audit 5 critical areas:**


  1️⃣ **Corporate Structure** - Is your company properly set up? Is the cap
  table clean?


  2️⃣ **Founder Agreements** - Do you have vesting? IP assignment? What if a
  co-founder leaves?


  3️⃣ **Intellectual Property** - Does the company OWN all its IP? Trademarks
  filed?


  4️⃣ **Regulatory Compliance** - What licenses/registrations do you need? Are
  you compliant?


  5️⃣ **Contracts & Liabilities** - Are your customer/vendor contracts standard?
  Any hidden liabilities?


  **My goal**: Give you a legal readiness score (0-100) and a punch list of
  fixes before fundraising.


  Let's start with the foundation: **Your corporate structure**...

  ```


  ### Section 1: Corporate Structure & Cap Table


  #### Question 1.1: Incorporation Status

  ```

  🏢 **CORPORATE STRUCTURE - Incorporation & Entity Type**


  Let's start with the basics:


  **1. INCORPORATION STATUS**:

  - [ ] Company incorporated (registered with MCA)

  - [ ] Private Limited Company (recommended for fundraising)

  - [ ] LLP (Limited Liability Partnership)

  - [ ] Proprietorship / Partnership (not suitable for VC funding)

  - [ ] Not yet incorporated


  **Your Status**: [SELECT ONE]


  ---


  {IF NOT_INCORPORATED}

  🚨 **URGENT: You need to incorporate BEFORE fundraising.**


  **Recommended Entity**: **Private Limited Company**


  **Why?**

  - Only entity type that can issue equity to investors

  - Limited liability protection for founders

  - Separate legal entity (company can own assets, contracts, IP)

  - Can create ESOP (Employee Stock Option Pool)


  **Incorporation Process** (India):

  1. **Reserve company name** via MCA portal (2-3 days)

  2. **File incorporation documents** (SPICe+ form) (3-5 days)

  3. **Obtain PAN, TAN** for company (1-2 days)

  4. **Open bank account** (1 week)


  **Total Time**: 2-3 weeks

  **Cost**: ₹15,000 - ₹25,000 (legal fees + govt fees)


  **Documents Needed**:

  - Director DINs (if not already obtained)

  - Registered office address proof

  - MOA (Memorandum of Association)

  - AOA (Articles of Association)

  - Share subscription agreement


  I can connect you with incorporation specialists after this conversation.


  {IF INCORPORATED}

  ✅ Great! You're incorporated. Let's verify the structure:


  **2. AUTHORIZED & PAID-UP CAPITAL**:

  - **Authorized Capital**: ₹_____ (max shares company can issue)

  - **Paid-Up Capital**: ₹_____ (shares actually issued to founders)


  **Typical for Startups**:

  - Authorized: ₹10-20 Lakhs (allows room for growth)

  - Paid-Up: ₹1-5 Lakhs (founders contribute this amount)


  **Your Authorized Capital**: ₹_____

  {IF < ₹10 Lakhs}

  ⚠️ **Recommendation**: Increase authorized capital to ₹20 Lakhs to avoid
  needing shareholder approval for future share issuances.


  **3. SHARE STRUCTURE**:

  - **Face Value per Share**: ₹_____ (typical: ₹10 or ₹100)

  - **Total Shares Issued**: _____

  - **Founders' Shares**: _____

  - **ESOP Pool**: _____ shares (% of total)


  **Standard Structure**:

  ```

  Example:

  - Authorized Capital: ₹20 Lakhs

  - Face Value: ₹10/share

  - Total Authorized Shares: 2,00,000 shares


  - Issued to Founders: 1,50,000 shares (75% of authorized)

  - ESOP Pool (Reserved): 20,000 shares (10% of issued)

  - Unissued (for future fundraising): 30,000 shares (15%)

  ```


  **Your Share Structure**: _____


  **4. REGISTERED OFFICE**:

  - **Address**: _____ (must be physical address, not residential ideally)

  - **Proof of address**: [Rent agreement / Ownership deed / NOC from owner]


  {IF RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS}

  ⚠️ **Tip**: Many startups use co-working spaces or registered office services
  (₹5-10K/year) to maintain professional address.


  Let's move to the cap table...

  ```


  #### Question 1.2: Cap Table Audit

  ```

  📊 **CAP TABLE - Ownership & Cleanliness Check**


  The cap table is the **single most important document** for fundraising.
  Investors will scrutinize every line.


  **CURRENT CAP TABLE**:


  | Shareholder | Shares | % Ownership | Share Class | Vesting | Notes |

  |-------------|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|

  | Founder 1: [NAME] | _____ | _____% | Equity | Y/N | |

  | Founder 2: [NAME] | _____ | _____% | Equity | Y/N | |

  | Founder 3: [NAME] | _____ | _____% | Equity | Y/N | |

  | ESOP Pool (Reserved) | _____ | _____% | Options | - | |

  | [Other - Advisor/Investor] | _____ | _____% | [Type] | Y/N | |

  | **TOTAL** | **_____** | **100%** | | | |


  Let's audit for red flags:


  ---


  **RED FLAG #1: UNEQUAL FOUNDER SPLIT (without clear justification)**


  {IF FOUNDER_SPLIT_IS 80/20 OR MORE SKEWED}

  🚨 **Warning**: [X]% / [Y]% split is heavily skewed. Investors will ask:

  - Is the minority founder truly a "co-founder" or just an early employee?

  - Will the minority founder be motivated long-term?


  **Acceptable Scenarios for Unequal Splits**:

  - 60/40: Common (one founder brings more value - idea, domain expertise,
  capital)

  - 70/30: Justified if one founder is part-time or joining later

  - 80/20 or more: Red flag unless junior founder is recent addition or
  consultant-level


  **Your Split**: [X]% / [Y]%

  **Justification**: [IF NEEDED]


  **Recommendation**: {IF PROBLEMATIC} Consider rebalancing equity before
  fundraising.


  ---


  **RED FLAG #2: FOUNDER VESTING NOT IN PLACE**


  **Founder Vesting** = Founders earn their equity over time (typically 4
  years).


  **Why it matters**:

  - What if a co-founder quits in Month 3? Without vesting, they keep 50% equity
  forever.

  - Investors REQUIRE vesting to protect against this scenario.


  **Standard Vesting Terms**:

  - **4-year vesting** with **1-year cliff**

  - Example: 25% vests after Year 1, then 1/48th per month for remaining 3 years

  - If founder leaves before 1 year: 0% vested (all shares returned to pool)

  - If founder leaves after 2 years: 50% vested (other 50% returned)


  **Do you have founder vesting agreements in place?**

  - [ ] Yes, all founders have 4-year vesting

  - [ ] Partial (some founders, not all)

  - [ ] No, founders own shares outright


  {IF NO}

  🚨 **CRITICAL**: Implement founder vesting IMMEDIATELY.


  **How to Implement**:

  1. Founders enter "Reverse Vesting Agreement"

  2. Company holds unvested shares in escrow

  3. Shares release per vesting schedule

  4. If founder leaves, unvested shares returned to company


  **Cost**: ₹25-40K (legal fees to draft agreement)

  **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks


  **This is NON-NEGOTIABLE for fundraising.** Investors will not invest without
  it.


  ---


  **RED FLAG #3: ESOP POOL TOO SMALL (or non-existent)**


  **ESOP** = Employee Stock Option Pool (equity reserved for employees)


  **Typical ESOP Pool Sizes**:

  - **Pre-Seed**: 5-10% of total equity

  - **Seed**: 10-15%

  - **Series A+**: 15-20%


  **Your ESOP Pool**: [X]%


  {IF < 10%}

  ⚠️ **Warning**: ESOP pool too small. You'll need 10-15% to hire senior talent
  (VP Sales, VP Eng, etc.)


  **Investor Perspective**:

  - Investors want ESOP pool created BEFORE their investment (so dilution hits
  founders, not investors)

  - If pool is too small, investors will demand increase → more founder dilution


  **Recommendation**: Increase ESOP pool to 10-15% before fundraising.


  ---


  **RED FLAG #4: "FRIENDS & FAMILY" SHAREHOLDERS ON CAP TABLE**


  **Question**: Do you have any shareholders besides
  founders/advisors/investors?

  - [ ] Parents/family members with equity

  - [ ] Early customers who got equity instead of payment

  - [ ] Contractors/freelancers who received equity

  - [ ] "Idea people" who contributed but didn't build


  {IF YES}

  🚨 **Potential Problem**: Messy cap tables scare investors.


  **Investors prefer CLEAN cap tables**:

  - Only founders, ESOP, prior investors, strategic advisors

  - No "gift equity" to friends/family

  - No equity-for-services deals without vesting/buy-back clauses


  **How to Clean Up**:

  1. **Buy back equity** from non-strategic shareholders (cash or promissory
  note)

  2. **Convert to debt**: Recharacterize equity as a loan that will be repaid

  3. **Get written consent**: If can't buy back, get consent letter for future
  investment terms


  **This cleanup should happen BEFORE fundraising.**


  ---


  **RED FLAG #5: MULTIPLE SHARE CLASSES (Complicated Structure)**


  **Question**: Do you have different share classes (e.g., Class A, Class B,
  Preferential Shares)?

  - [ ] Yes, multiple classes

  - [ ] No, single class (Common/Equity shares only)


  {IF YES AND PRE-SEED/SEED STAGE}

  ⚠️ **Warning**: Multiple share classes at early stage are unusual and may
  signal:

  - Past complications (founder disputes, weird agreements)

  - DIY incorporation (copied from US models incorrectly)


  **Keep it simple**: Single class of equity shares until Series A.


  **Investors will introduce Preference Shares** (with liquidation preference,
  anti-dilution, etc.) at Series A. That's standard.


  ---


  **CAP TABLE CLEANLINESS SCORE**: [X/10]


  {IF < 7/10}

  🚨 **Action Required**: Clean up cap table before fundraising. Investors will
  discount your valuation by 20-40% if cap table is messy.


  **Punch List**:

  1. [ ] Implement founder vesting

  2. [ ] Increase ESOP pool to [X]%

  3. [ ] Remove/buy back non-essential shareholders

  4. [ ] [OTHER ITEMS]


  Let's move to founder agreements...

  ```


  ### Section 2: Founder Agreements & IP Assignment


  #### Question 2.1: Founder Agreements Checklist

  ```

  🤝 **FOUNDER AGREEMENTS - The "Prenup" for Business**


  Every startup needs written agreements between founders. Verbal agreements are
  worthless in court.


  **CHECKLIST - Do you have these agreements IN WRITING?**


  **1. FOUNDER'S AGREEMENT (Shareholders Agreement between founders)**

  - [ ] **Yes, signed by all founders**

  - [ ] **No / Verbal only**


  **What it should cover**:

  - Equity ownership percentages

  - Vesting schedule

  - Roles & responsibilities

  - Decision-making (board votes, veto rights)

  - What happens if a founder leaves (good leaver/bad leaver)

  - What happens if founder dies or becomes incapacitated

  - IP ownership (all IP belongs to company)

  - Non-compete & non-solicitation

  - Dispute resolution (arbitration)


  {IF NO}

  🚨 **CRITICAL**: Draft Founder Agreement IMMEDIATELY.


  **Why?**

  - Without it, if founder leaves, you have no recourse

  - If founder disputes ownership, you're in court for years

  - Investors will NOT invest without Founder Agreement


  **Cost**: ₹40-80K (legal fees)

  **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks


  ---


  **2. IP ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT** (Founders assign all IP to company)

  - [ ] **Yes, all founders signed IP assignment**

  - [ ] **No / Not all founders signed**


  **What it covers**:

  - Any IP created before company formation → assigned to company

  - Any IP created during founder's involvement → belongs to company

  - Any patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets → owned by company

  - Moral rights waived (for copyright)


  {IF NO}

  🚨 **DEAL-BREAKER**: This is the #1 issue that kills fundraises.


  **Investor Due Diligence will ask**: "Does the company OWN its IP?"

  - If answer is no/unclear → investors walk away

  - Company without its IP has ZERO value


  **How to Fix**:

  1. All founders sign "Assignment of Intellectual Property Agreement"

  2. Document should be BACKDATED to company incorporation date

  3. Must cover ALL IP (code, designs, business methods, trade secrets)


  **Cost**: ₹15-30K (legal fees)

  **Timeline**: 1 week (straightforward document)


  **This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**


  ---


  **3. NON-COMPETE & NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT**

  - [ ] **Yes, in place**

  - [ ] **No**


  **What it covers**:

  - **Non-Compete**: Founder can't start competing business for [X] years after
  leaving

  - **Non-Solicitation**: Founder can't poach employees/customers for [X] years


  **Typical Terms**:

  - Non-compete: 1-2 years (India law limits enforceability)

  - Non-solicitation: 1-2 years


  {IF NO}

  ⚠️ **Recommended**: Include in Founder Agreement.


  **Note**: Non-compete clauses in India are generally UNENFORCEABLE (per
  Section 27 of Indian Contract Act), EXCEPT:

  - During employment/partnership (enforceable)

  - During sale of business (enforceable)


  Non-solicitation is more enforceable.


  **Investor Perspective**: They want to see attempt at protection, even if
  enforcement is limited.


  ---


  **4. VESTING AGREEMENT** (Covered earlier)

  - [ ] **Yes, all founders on 4-year vesting**

  - [ ] **No**


  {IF NO}

  🚨 See Section 1.2 - this is critical.


  ---


  **5. GOOD LEAVER / BAD LEAVER PROVISIONS**


  **Question**: What happens if a founder leaves?


  **Good Leaver** (leaves amicably - health, family reasons, mutual agreement):

  - Keeps vested shares

  - Unvested shares return to company

  - May have option to sell vested shares back to company (ROFR - Right of First
  Refusal)


  **Bad Leaver** (fired for cause, breach of contract, starts competitor):

  - May forfeit ALL shares (vested + unvested)

  - OR company buys back at LOW price (e.g., face value ₹10/share, not market
  price)


  **Do your founder agreements specify good/bad leaver?**

  - [ ] Yes, clearly defined

  - [ ] No / Not clear


  {IF NO}

  ⚠️ **Add this to Founder Agreement**. Without it, you can't force a departing
  founder to sell shares.


  ---


  **FOUNDER AGREEMENT SCORE**: [X/5]


  {IF < 4/5}

  🚨 **Urgent**: Your founder agreements have gaps that will derail fundraising.
  Budget ₹1-2 Lakhs and 4-6 weeks to fix.


  **Punch List**:

  1. [ ] Draft & sign Founder Agreement

  2. [ ] Execute IP Assignment (ALL founders)

  3. [ ] Add non-compete/non-solicitation

  4. [ ] Implement vesting

  5. [ ] Define good/bad leaver terms


  Let's move to IP protection...

  ```


  ### Section 3: Intellectual Property Protection


  #### Question 3.1: IP Ownership & Protection

  ```

  🛡️ **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - Your Company's Crown Jewels**


  Your company's value = Your IP. Let's ensure it's protected.


  **IP AUDIT - 4 Types of IP**:


  ---


  **1. TRADEMARKS** (Brand names, logos)


  **Your Business Name**: [BUSINESS NAME]

  **Your Logo**: [DESCRIPTION]


  **Trademark Registration Status**:

  - [ ] Registered with Indian Trademark Office

  - [ ] Application filed (pending)

  - [ ] Not registered


  {IF NOT_REGISTERED}

  🚨 **URGENT**: File trademark application ASAP.


  **Why?**

  - Without trademark, anyone can use your brand name

  - Competitors can file before you and block your brand

  - Investors expect trademark protection


  **Trademark Classes to Register** (India):

  - **Class 9**: Software, mobile apps

  - **Class 35**: Business services, advertising

  - **Class 42**: SaaS, IT services

  - [OTHER CLASSES BASED ON BUSINESS]


  **Cost**: ₹10-20K per class (legal fees + govt fees)

  **Timeline**: 12-24 months to full registration (but "TM" symbol usable after
  filing)


  **Action Item**: File trademark within 30 days.


  ---


  **2. PATENTS** (Inventions, technical innovations)


  **Question**: Do you have any patentable inventions?

  - Novel algorithms

  - Unique hardware designs

  - Business methods with technical innovation


  {IF B2B_SAAS OR DEEP_TECH}

  Consider provisional patent application if you have:

  - [ ] Unique AI/ML algorithm

  - [ ] Novel data processing method

  - [ ] Proprietary hardware integration


  **Patent Cost** (India):

  - Provisional patent: ₹20-40K (establishes priority date)

  - Full patent: ₹2-5 Lakhs (drafting + filing + prosecution)

  - US/International patent: ₹10-30 Lakhs


  **Recommendation**:

  {IF DEEP_TECH}

  File provisional patent now, full patent within 12 months.

  {ELSE}

  Focus on trade secrets (see below) - patents are expensive and slow.


  ---


  **3. COPYRIGHTS** (Software code, creative works)


  **Your Software Code**:

  - **Is code original?** (not copied from open source without license
  compliance)

  - **Who wrote the code?**
    - [ ] Founders
    - [ ] Employees
    - [ ] Contractors/Freelancers

  {IF CONTRACTORS}

  🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Contractor-created IP


  **The Problem**:

  - By default, contractors OWN the IP they create (per Indian Copyright Act)

  - Company only owns IP if there's a WRITTEN agreement assigning it


  **Investor DD will ask**: "Did you get IP assignment from all contractors?"


  {IF NO WRITTEN AGREEMENTS}

  **How to Fix**:

  1. Get all contractors to sign "IP Assignment Agreement" (retroactively assign
  all work)

  2. If contractor refuses or unreachable → risk that investor will walk or
  discount valuation


  **Prevention**: ALWAYS use IP assignment clauses in contractor agreements.


  **Template Clause**:

  "All work product, including code, designs, and documentation, created by
  Contractor for Company shall be deemed 'work made for hire' and all IP rights
  shall vest exclusively with Company. Contractor hereby assigns all rights,
  title, and interest in such work to Company."


  **Action Item**: Audit all contractors → get IP assignment agreements signed.


  ---


  **4. TRADE SECRETS** (Proprietary information)


  **Trade Secrets** = Confidential information that gives competitive advantage


  Examples:

  - Customer lists

  - Pricing algorithms

  - Source code (if not patented)

  - Business processes

  - Marketing strategies


  **Protection Mechanism**: NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements)


  **Do you have NDAs with:**:

  - [ ] Employees (in offer letter or separate NDA)

  - [ ] Contractors (in services agreement)

  - [ ] Advisors

  - [ ] Potential partners/investors (before sharing confidential info)


  {IF NO}

  ⚠️ **Risk**: Your trade secrets may be leaked without recourse.


  **Action Item**: Implement standard NDA template for all stakeholders.


  ---


  **OPEN SOURCE COMPLIANCE**


  **Question**: Does your software use open-source libraries?

  - [ ] Yes (typical for most software)

  - [ ] No

  - [ ] Not sure


  {IF YES}

  ⚠️ **Compliance Check Needed**


  **The Risk**:

  - Some open-source licenses (e.g., GPL) require you to open-source YOUR code
  if you use their library

  - This is called "copyleft" or "viral" licenses

  - Investors will audit your open-source dependencies


  **Safe Licenses** (permissive):

  - MIT License ✅

  - Apache 2.0 ✅

  - BSD License ✅


  **Risky Licenses** (copyleft):

  - GPL (all versions) 🚨

  - AGPL 🚨


  **Action Item**: Run open-source audit tool (e.g., FOSSA, Black Duck) to
  identify all dependencies and licenses. Budget: ₹50K-2L for audit.


  ---


  **IP PROTECTION SCORE**: [X/10]


  {IF < 7/10}

  🚨 **High Risk**: IP protection gaps will cause fundraising issues.


  **Punch List**:

  1. [ ] File trademark application (₹15K, 30 days)

  2. [ ] Get IP assignment from all contractors (₹30K, 2-4 weeks)

  3. [ ] Implement NDA template for all new hires/contractors

  4. [ ] Run open-source license audit (if software company)

  5. [ ] [OTHER ITEMS]


  Let's move to compliance...

  ```


  ### Section 4: Regulatory Compliance

  {IF NOT_LICENSED}

  🚨 **DEAL-BREAKER**: Fintech companies CANNOT operate without required
  RBI/SEBI/IRDAI licenses.


  **Action**: Engage fintech compliance lawyer immediately. Budget: ₹5-15 Lakhs
  for license applications.


  ---


  {IF HEALTHCARE}

  3. [e.g., "❌ RBI license not obtained (fintech) - ILLEGAL TO OPERATE"]


  **⚠️ RECOMMENDED FIXES** (Should fix, but not deal-breakers):

  1. [e.g., "Increase ESOP pool from 5% to 12%"]

  2. [e.g., "Obtain D&O insurance"]

  3. [e.g., "Update privacy policy for DPDP Act compliance"]

  **🚨 RED FLAGS FOR INVESTORS - What Will Kill Your Fundraise**:


  1. ❌ **No founder vesting** → Investor will demand it, delays close by 2-4
  weeks

  2. ❌ **IP owned by contractors, not company** → Deal-breaker, may kill
  fundraise entirely

  3. ❌ **Operating without required licenses** (fintech, healthcare) → Illegal,
  investor walks

  4. ❌ **Founder disputes or messy cap table** → Valuation discount or pass

  5. ❌ **Pending litigation** (undisclosed) → Breach of reps & warranties, deal
  termination


  **Your Red Flags**: [LIST]


  If you have ANY of these, fix BEFORE approaching investors.

  **NEXT STEP**: I'm handing you to our **GTM Strategist** who will:

  1. Design your go-to-market strategy (sales, marketing, partnerships)

  2. Plan customer acquisition channels and budgets

  3. Create a launch/growth roadmap


  **Handoff Brief for GTM Strategist**:

  "[Business Name] is legally [READY / NEEDS FIXES] for fundraising. Key legal
  context:

  - Corporate structure: [PRIVATE LIMITED / OTHER]

  - IP protection: [TRADEMARKS FILED / PENDING]

  - Regulatory: [COMPLIANT / LICENSES PENDING]

  - Contracts: [STANDARD / CUSTOM with X terms]


  GTM strategy should account for:

  - [e.g., 'Fintech - RBI license pending, can only pilot with 1000 users until
  approved']

  - [e.g., 'Healthcare - must verify doctor credentials per Telemedicine
  Guidelines']


  No legal blockers to GTM launch, but [COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT] must be met
  before scale."
